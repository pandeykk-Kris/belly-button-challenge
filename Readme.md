# Module 14 Challenge

Used Javascript, D3 library, Plotly to create an interactive dashboard to visualize Belly button biodiversity. The dataset was provided as a .json link.

1. used D3 libray to read .json URL.
2. created the dashboard to allow dropdown menu to select particular dataset based on sample "id" value.

3. selected metadata and using object entries made key:value pairs. created horizonal bar chart in reverse (descenidng order). The plot was shown using Plotly.
4. created a bubble chart to display the bacteria count and their OTU ID (bacteria type).
5. fucntion was added to update the dashboard when a new dataset is selcted using dropdown menu.
console.log(); was used at several instance to monitor the outputs.

# Dashboard is deployed on github.

# Result shows that bacteria are present at very high number on our body. 
Infact, per scientists we have nearly similar number of bacteria as our total cell numbers. Most of the bacteria do not harm humans and may be beneficial in several instances.
